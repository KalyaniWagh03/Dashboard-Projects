## Executive Summary:

- Using SQL, Python, and Tableau, I analyzed the King County House Sales dataset to uncover trends and patterns in housing prices, property attributes, and other factors. 
- The analysis identified key factors influencing house prices, such as location, square footage, and year built. 
- Based on the findings, several recommendations have been made to leverage these insights for strategic decision-making in the real estate market.

### Business Problem:

- Understanding trends and factors influencing house prices is crucial for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions. 
- This dataset helps identify the impact of different property attributes on house prices, the effect of location, and other factors correlating with the value of homes. 
- How can we use this data to predict future trends and make strategic decisions in the real estate market?
