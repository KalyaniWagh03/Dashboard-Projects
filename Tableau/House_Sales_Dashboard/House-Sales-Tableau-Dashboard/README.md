- Based on the findings, several recommendations have been made to leverage these insights for strategic decision-making in the real estate market.

### Business Problem:

- Understanding trends and factors influencing house prices is crucial for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions. 
- This dataset helps identify the impact of different property attributes on house prices, the effect of location, and other factors correlating with the value of homes. 
- How can we use this data to predict future trends and make strategic decisions in the real estate market?


### Methodology:

1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning:**
   - SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database.
   - Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Creating visualizations in Tableau to represent the distribution of house prices, property attributes, and other factors.
   - Building interactive dashboards to track trends over time.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - Using Python for in-depth analysis and modelling.
   - Applying statistical methods to identify key factors influencing house prices.

### Skills:

- **SQL:** CTEs, Joins, Case, Aggregate Functions
- **Tableau:** Data Visualization, Interactive Dashboards, Data Modeling
- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Writing Functions, Statistical Analysis
- **Data Analysis:** Statistically analyzing and interpreting complex data sets to drive insights and decisions

### Results & Business Recommendation:

We provided insights into housing trends and factors influencing house prices by analyzing the King County House Sales dataset. 
Key findings include the impact of location, square footage, and year built on house prices. 
Based on these insights, we recommend the following actions:
